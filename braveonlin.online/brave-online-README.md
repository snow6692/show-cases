##  Architecture

This project follows a **monorepo** structure:

```
├── server/          # Hono.js REST API with OpenAPI docs
├── frontend/        # TanStack Start (Admin & Teacher dashboards)
├── shared/          # Shared types, Zod schemas, i18n translations
└── mobile/          # Flutter app (Student-facing)
```

##  Key Features

### 👥 Role-Based Access Control
- **Admin** — Full system control: manage users, courses, universities, payments, QR codes, and all platform settings.
- **Teacher** — Manage assigned courses: create chapters, lessons, videos, PDFs. View enrolled students and revenue.
- **Student** — Access enrolled courses, take quizzes, join chats, and track learning progress.

###  Academic Hierarchy
- Organized structure: **University → College → Department → Level**
- All courses, students, teachers, and content are scoped within this hierarchy.

###  Course Management
- Create, edit, publish, and archive courses
- Drag-and-drop curriculum builder (Chapters → Lessons → Videos/PDFs)
- Discount and coupon system
- Draft/publish workflow
- Term types: Regular and Summer

###  Enrollment System (3 Methods)
1. **Join Request** — Student submits, Admin/Teacher approves or rejects.
2. **QR Code** — Admin generates single-use QR codes in batches. Each code activates course access instantly.
3. **Payment** — Student submits payment proof (Vodafone Cash / InstaPay). Admin/Teacher verifies.

###  Time-Based Course Access
- All course access is controlled through `CourseAccess` records with start and expiration dates.
- Access is automatically revoked upon expiration.
- No user directly "owns" a course — access is always time-bound.

###  Real-Time Chat System
- **Course Chat** — Group chat for all enrolled students + teacher.
- **Private Chat** — Direct messaging between student and course teacher.
- **Support Chat** — Student ↔ Admin communication.
- Permission-based access tied to course enrollment.

###  Notifications
- Push notifications via **Firebase FCM**
- Triggers: new courses, new lessons, messages, access approval/expiration.

###  Device-Based Security (Mobile Only)
- Each student account is bound to **one device** via `deviceId`.
- Device mismatch on login → account temporarily blocked.
- **Device Recovery** — Student submits a recovery request; Admin approves/rejects.
- Admins and Teachers are exempt from device restrictions.

- Users **never own courses directly** — all access is time-based via `CourseAccess`.
- QR codes are **single-use** and cannot be reused.
- Teachers can **only manage their own courses**.
- Admin can **override any action**.
- Permissions are enforced in **backend logic**, not database roles.
